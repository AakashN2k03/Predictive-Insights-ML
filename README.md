**MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS ON PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS**

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project repository!
This project includes the implementation of four machine learning models for various tasks, including regression analysis, classification, and content-based recommendation system.

**Overview *8
In this project, we have developed and trained four machine learning models:

**1.Crude Oil Price Prediction (Linear Regression Model):**
  Implemented a linear regression model to predict crude oil prices based on historical data.
  

**2.Jamboree Website (Regression Model):**
  Created a regression model to predict the probabilities of university admissions for international students applying through Jamboree, an educational consulting platform.
Note: Jamboree is an educational consulting organization that assists students with university admissions abroad.

**3.Diabetes Prediction (Logistic Regression Model):**
  Built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health indicators and risk factors.

**4.Hotel Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering):**
   Developed a content-based recommendation system for hotel management.
Users can input a country, and the model outputs the top recommended hotels in that country based on predefined features.
